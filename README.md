In this file I will list the procedures I have used in order to complete this challenge.

I have started doing the tests for the following User Story
<!-- 
 As a customer
 So that I can check if I want to order something
 I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
 -->

 I have created a class 'Menu' that it's only function , for now, is to display the menu.
 And this is the feature test in IRB
 
 <!-- Makerss-MacBook-Pro-2:takeaway-challenge student$ irb -r './lib/menu.rb' 
2.5.0 :001 > menu = Menu.new
 => #<Menu:0x00007f9fbd042748> 
2.5.0 :002 > menu.display
spring roll: 0.99
char sui bun: 3.99
pork dumpling: 2.99
peking duck: 7.99
fu-king fried rice: 5.99
 => {"spring roll"=>0.99, "char sui bun"=>3.99, "pork dumpling"=>2.99, "peking duck"=>7.99, "fu-king fried rice"=>5.99}
